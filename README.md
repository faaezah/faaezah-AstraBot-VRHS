# Astra: The Study Assistant That Teaches 🤖🎓

Astra is a full-stack AI-powered study assistant built by Faaezah Ahmed Shaik for her Machine Learning club. It’s a solo mission to build something that actually helps students learn.

## 🧠 Why Astra Exists

Most AI tools just give answers. Astra is built to do more — to guide students through how to think, how to approach problems, and how to grow. Especially for advanced learners in AP and honors classes, Astra is designed to be a real assistant, not just a shortcut.

## 🧩 What Astra Can Do

- **Flask-based backend** with secure routing and session tracking
- **Natural language processing** using `spaCy` for subject detection
- **Voice input/output** with `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`
- **Profanity filtering** to keep responses clean and classroom-safe
- **Quiz generation** using custom logic and external APIs
- **Web interface** with feedback handling and voice mode
- **Voice-only script** for hands-free use

## 🔐 Security First

API keys are never exposed or committed on Github.

## Built by Faaezah Ahmed Shaik

Faaezah is a passionate high school student, keen on uplifting the STEM community. Her journey in Computer Science began after moving to America from her cherished home in London. After feeling lost in the labyrinth of the new school and the people, she decided to try and take on a new hobby. One Google search changed her life, revealing to her the art of coding. She has been an avid member in robotics, serving as Vice Captain for a community team and now as the software/programming lead at her school.

Aside from robotics, she has also recently started her organization, **"The Coding Atelier by Faaezah"**, which helps give underprivileged children in both Austin and India access to technology. Furthermore, she has contributed to cybersecurity research by conducting an experiment that explores the strengths of various encryption algorithms to protect SSNs.

Faaezah is currently working on improving her machine learning expertise so that she can, in the future, develop a technology that uses a trained AI model to help users protect their devices with the ease of just one click. She aspires to study at Harvard University's CS 181 course, which dives deep into fundamental machine learning concepts.

At just 14 years old, Faaezah has started an organization, led teams, and raised $1000 from teaching Java in her community. She knows this is just the beginning — and she looks forward to seeing how her STEM career will unfold in the years to come.
